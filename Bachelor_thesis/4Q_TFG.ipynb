The circuit is inspired in the analytical solution to solve the XY model, however in this case the aim of the circuit is not diagonalize our Hamiltonian but pass from the diagonal computational basis to the entangled spin state of the XY model. \n",

This states respresent the Bogoliubov fermionic bases with each Qbit represents the $4$ $k$ values possible for the Bogoulibov states in a suitable order to apply the Bogoliubov gates. \n",

    "\n",
    "$$B(k,n)=\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "    \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{k}}{2}\\right) & 0 & 0 & -i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{k}}{2}\\right)\\\\\n",

The reason why this is necessary it is explained in the Jordan-Wigner section (subchapter 3 of this same chapter).\n",
    "\n",
    "After this transformation our new states are now fourier states. The new state is written in the base $\\ket{k=0,k=2,k=1,k=-1}_{b}$, which is exactly the same as the bogoulibov base, but with $b$ subindex to delimitate that now the different state denoted free fermions with a $k$ momentum defined.\n",

    "### 3) Jordan-Wigner Transformation:\n",

    "\n",
    "This transformation does not require any additional gates, the problem is that the spin state $\\ket{\\uparrow}=\\ket{1}$ and  $\\ket{\\downarrow}=\\ket{0}$. Consequently, if one uses the pauli matrix convention where  $\\ket{\\uparrow}=(1,0)^{T}$ vector, then  one has to abandone the standard convention for N-body systems where the void vector $\\ket{0}=(1,0)^{T}$. \n",
